Keybase is a key directory that maps social media identities to encryption keys (including, but not limited to PGP keys) in a publicly auditable manner.[2] Additionally it offers an end-to-end encrypted chat and cloud storage system,[3][4] called Keybase Chat and the Keybase Filesystem respectively. Files placed in the public portion of the filesystem are served from a public endpoint,[4] as well as locally from a filesystem mounted by the Keybase client.[5]
