# Awesome *Missing* Healthcare [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

* A curated, un-awesomelist of *Missing* NHS, Healthcare and Social Care interfaces, services, registers, and data sources.
* This is a 'partner' list to the Awesome Healthcare list https://github.com/kakoni/awesome-healthcare here I'm focusing on what's needed but conspicuously absent.

## National web services and APIs
* ['Gravatar' for patient photos](https://github.com/pacharanero/awesome-missing-nhs-things/issues/1)
* 'KeyBase' for clinical staff
* Ambulance Booking API
* [National Consent Platform]()
* REST API wrapper over the NHS E-Referral Service
* REST API wrapper over the NHS E-Prescriptions Service

## Registers
* GMC number API lookup
* NMC number API lookup
* GP Practices register API
* Pharmacies register API

## Clinical Tools
* comprehensive, clinically assured, clinical calculation API
* comprehensive, clinically assured, clinical decision support API

## NHS Platform Tools
* Open source cross-platform Identity Agent (for NHS SmartCard use)
* Full implementation of the NHS Spine 'Warranted Environment' in open source (this was the aim of the NHSbuntu/NHoS project)
* Client libraries and proper documentation for all Spine services.
* REST wrapper for all Spine services, doing the hard work to make it simple. The madness of CDA, HL7 and MESH needs to be hidden from view.

## Frameworks and Libraries
* NHS Common User Interface (or the good bits of it) implemented as a CSS-class-based web UI framework that can be dropped into new or existing web applications, lending them an instant UI which is ready clinically-, usability- and accessibility-tested.

## Data gathering and Intelligence
* NHS PC Benchmarking - a downloadable open source software agent which benchmarks the PC being used and reports back to a central authority via web on: installed OS, patch level, RAM, CPU, disk, installed software, network bandwidth, and other information that would help national IT resources to be distributed in the most effective way possible.

## Open Source NHS Staff Online Training platform
* NHS staff undergo regular (usually annual) retraining on topics such as:
  * Child and Adult Safeguarding
  * Infection Control and Hand Hygiene
  * Lifting and Handling
  * Information Governance and Computer Security
* At present this is usually provided through a series of [proprietary online training modules](https://www.bluestreamacademy.com/), often of [very low quality](https://twitter.com/marcus_baw/status/1113058212150829059), and provided by a number of private companies at at least moderate taxpayer expense. The *content* for the platforms has quite often been originally provided (in some convoluted way eg a 'partnership') by NHS staff themselves and therefore paid for by UK taxes.
* The requirement for a simple, high-quality, modern e-Learning platform for the NHS would be relatively easy to fulfil compared to some of the other awesomely-missing things on this list, and would save considerable money.
